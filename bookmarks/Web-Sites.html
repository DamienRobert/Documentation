<h1 id="chan--8-chan">4 chan / 8 chan</h1>

<p>TL;DR as possible: Founder of 4chan started dating a feminist/sjw or something. 4chan, naturally, is immature and offensive, so to try to appease her he kicked all of 4chan’s mods and replaced them with stricter SJW mods that began banning people for talking about gamergate, Ferguson, offensive words like nigger, etc. This didn’t effect the majority of the site but /pol/ (which is the “politically incorrect” board, essentially designed to be offensive), /v/ (videogame board) and /b/ (anything goes board) were neutered by the censorship (kinda). Paralyzed guy and owner of a similar site known as 8chan points out that not only does his site work exactly like 4chan, it has more features and less censorship. People that were either banned or sick of the censorship on 4chan went over to 8chan’s boards. 8chan is still far smaller than 4chan though.</p>
