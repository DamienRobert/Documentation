Documentation extracted from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/DamienRobert/dotfiles)

We extract documentation written in markdown, and use `kramdown` to also
get an html output. For more documentations, see the
[originals](https://github.com/DamienRobert/dotfiles/tree/master/doc).

In particular, small documentation files not written in markdown are not
extracted here.

*Warning*: These documentations files are for my own reference, and
probably would need a lot of polishing to be useful to someone else.

Furthermore I write them in pseudo-markdown syntax (to have automatic
folding and nice syntax highlighting in vim), which makes the html
conversion by kramdown or what github shows via the github flavored markdown
not optimal.

These files are best viewed by using `ft=markdown` in vim. In fact they are
best viewed by using the non standard `ft=markdownlight` filetype available
[here](https://github.com/DamienRobert/dotfiles/blob/master/user/config/dotfiles/.vim/syntax/markdownlight.vim).
