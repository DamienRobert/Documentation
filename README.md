Documentation extracted from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/DamienRobert/dotfiles)

We extract documentation written in markdown, and use `kramdown` to also
get an html output. For more documentation, see the
[originals](https://github.com/DamienRobert/dotfiles/tree/master/doc).

Small documentation file not written in markdown are not extracted here.
