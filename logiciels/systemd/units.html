<h1 id="config">Config</h1>

<p>Precedence is /etc/systemd/system, /run/systemd/system, /usr/lib/systemd/system
(cf [systemd] for the full list). This acts like an unionfs.</p>

<p>ploum.d/foo.conf dropfile are read in the alphabetical order (so a
00foo.conf in /etc will have less precedence than a 99foo.conf in /usr).</p>

<p>Variables that acts as list (like ExectStart, or ListenStream) get appended
when they are repeated (eg ListenStream=44007 in
sshd.socket.d/override.conf adds the port to the existing 22 one). To reset
the list, put ‘ListenStream=’ first.</p>

<p>ConditionPathExists=!foo =&gt; foo does not exist</p>

<p>If multiple conditions are specified, the unit will be executed if all of
  them apply (i.e. a logical AND is applied). Condition checks can be
  prefixed with a pipe symbol (|) in which case a condition becomes a
  triggering condition. If at least one triggering condition is defined for
  a unit, then the unit will be executed if at least one of the triggering
  conditions apply and all of the non-triggering conditions.</p>

<h2 id="mount-units">Mount Units</h2>

<p>Note that local-fs.target does have ‘DefaultDependencies=no’. So unless a

not wait for the mount.</p>

<p>systemd-fstab-generator:
- If noauto is specified, there is no dependendcy on the mount unit generated
- Otherwise there is a RequiredBy=local-fs.target and a Before=local-fs.target
- But if we add nofail, then the RequiredBy is a WantedBy and there is no
  Before=</p>

<h3 id="targets">targets</h3>
<pre><code>   ·   Target units will automatically complement all configured
       dependencies of type Wants= or Requires= with dependencies of type
       After= unless DefaultDependencies=no is set in the specified units.
       Note that Wants= or Requires= must be defined in the target unit
       itself — if you for example define Wants=some.target in
       some.service, the automatic ordering will not be added.

   ·   Target units automatically gain Conflicts= dependency against
       shutdown.target.
</code></pre>

<p>So to set up a target that launch units but do not wait for them it seems
like we should use DefaultDependencies=false</p>

<h3 id="services">services</h3>
<p>IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are implicitly added:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   Services with Type=dbus set automatically acquire dependencies of
       type Requires= and After= on dbus.socket.

   ·   Socket activated services are automatically ordered after their
       activating .socket units via an automatic After= dependency.
       Services also pull in all .socket units listed in Sockets= via
       automatic Wants= and After= dependencies.

   Additional implicit dependencies may be added as result of execution
   and resource control parameters as documented in systemd.exec(5) and
   systemd.resource-control(5).
</code></pre>

<p>DEFAULT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is
       set:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   Service units will have dependencies of type Requires= and After=
       on sysinit.target, a dependency of type After= on basic.target as
       well as dependencies of type Conflicts= and Before= on
       shutdown.target. These ensure that normal service units pull in
       basic system initialization, and are terminated cleanly prior to
       system shutdown. Only services involved with early boot or late
       system shutdown should disable this option.

   ·   Instanced service units (i.e. service units with an "@" in their
       name) are assigned by default a per-template slice unit (see
       systemd.slice(5)), named after the template unit, containing all
       instances of the specific template. This slice is normally stopped
       at shutdown, together with all template instances. If that is not
       desired, set DefaultDependencies=no in the template unit, and
       either define your own per-template slice unit file that also sets
       DefaultDependencies=no, or set Slice=system.slice (or another
       suitable slice) in the template unit. Also see systemd.resource-
       control(5). ### paths IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
   The following dependencies are implicitly added:

   ·   If a path unit is beneath another mount unit in the file system
       hierarchy, both a requirement and an ordering dependency between
       both units are created automatically.

   ·   An implicit Before= dependency is added between a path unit and the
       unit it is supposed to activate.
</code></pre>

<p>DEFAULT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is
       set:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   Path units will automatically have dependencies of type Before= on
       paths.target, dependencies of type After= and Requires= on
       sysinit.target, and have dependencies of type Conflicts= and
       Before= on shutdown.target. These ensure that path units are
       terminated cleanly prior to system shutdown. Only path units
       involved with early boot or late system shutdown should disable
       DefaultDependencies= option. ### sockets IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
   The following dependencies are implicitly added:

   ·   Socket units automatically gain a Before= dependency on the service
       units they activate.

   ·   Socket units referring to file system paths (such as AF_UNIX
       sockets or FIFOs) implicitly gain Requires= and After= dependencies
       on all mount units necessary to access those paths.

   ·   Socket units using the BindToDevice= setting automatically gain a
       BindsTo= and After= dependency on the device unit encapsulating the
       specified network interface.

   Additional implicit dependencies may be added as result of execution
   and resource control parameters as documented in systemd.exec(5) and
   systemd.resource-control(5).
</code></pre>

<p>DEFAULT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is
       set:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   Socket units automatically gain a Before= dependency on
       sockets.target.

   ·   Socket units automatically gain a pair of After= and Requires=
       dependency on sysinit.target, and a pair of Before= and Conflicts=
       dependencies on shutdown.target. These dependencies ensure that the
       socket unit is started before normal services at boot, and is
       stopped on shutdown. Only sockets involved with early boot or late
       system shutdown should disable DefaultDependencies= option. ### timers IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
   The following dependencies are implicitly added:

   ·   Timer units automatically gain a Before= dependency on the service
       they are supposed to activate.
</code></pre>

<p>DEFAULT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is
       set:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   Timer units will automatically have dependencies of type Requires=
       and After= on sysinit.target, a dependency of type Before= on
       timers.target, as well as Conflicts= and Before= on shutdown.target
       to ensure that they are stopped cleanly prior to system shutdown.
       Only timer units involved with early boot or late system shutdown
       should disable the DefaultDependencies= option.

   ·   Timer units with at least one OnCalendar= directive will have an
       additional After= dependency on time-sync.target to avoid being
       started before the system clock has been correctly set. ### mount IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
   The following dependencies are implicitly added:

   ·   If a mount unit is beneath another mount unit in the file system
       hierarchy, both a requirement dependency and an ordering dependency
       between both units are created automatically.

   ·   Block device backed file systems automatically gain BindsTo= and
       After= type dependencies on the device unit encapsulating the block
       device (see below).

   ·   If traditional file system quota is enabled for a mount unit,
       automatic Wants= and Before= dependencies on
       systemd-quotacheck.service and quotaon.service are added.

   ·   Additional implicit dependencies may be added as result of
       execution and resource control parameters as documented in
       systemd.exec(5) and systemd.resource-control(5).
</code></pre>

<p>DEFAULT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is
       set:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   All mount units acquire automatic Before= and Conflicts= on
       umount.target in order to be stopped during shutdown.

   ·   Mount units referring to local file systems automatically gain an
       After= dependency on local-fs-pre.target.

   ·   Network mount units automatically acquire After= dependencies on
       remote-fs-pre.target, network.target and network-online.target.
       Towards the latter a Wants= unit is added as well.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="automount">automount</h3>
<p>IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are implicitly added:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   If an automount unit is beneath another mount unit in the file
       system hierarchy, both a requirement and an ordering dependency
       between both units are created automatically.

   ·   An implicit Before= dependency is created between an automount unit
       and the mount unit it activates.
</code></pre>

<p>DEFAULT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is
       set:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   Automount units acquire automatic Before= and Conflicts= on
       umount.target in order to be stopped during shutdown.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="swap">swap</h3>
<p>IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are implicitly added:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   All swap units automatically get the BindsTo= and After=
       dependencies on the device units or the mount units of the files
       they are activated from.

   Additional implicit dependencies may be added as result of execution
   and resource control parameters as documented in systemd.exec(5) and
   systemd.resource-control(5).
</code></pre>

<p>DEFAULT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is
       set:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   Swap units automatically acquire a Conflicts= and a Before=
       dependency on umount.target so that they are deactivated at
       shutdown as well as a Before=swap.target dependency.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="devices">devices</h3>
<p>IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
       Many unit types automatically acquire dependencies on device units of
       devices they require. For example, .socket unit acquire dependencies on
       the device units of the network interface specified in BindToDevice=.
       Similar, swap and mount units acquire dependencies on the units
       encapsulating their backing block devices.
### scope
DEFAULT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is
       set:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   Scope units will automatically have dependencies of type Conflicts=
       and Before= on shutdown.target. These ensure that scope units are
       removed prior to system shutdown. Only scope units involved with
       early boot or late system shutdown should disable
       DefaultDependencies= option. ### slice IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
   The following dependencies are implicitly added:

   ·   Slice units automatically gain dependencies of type After= and
       Requires= on their immediate parent slice unit.
</code></pre>

<p>DEFAULT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are added unless DefaultDependencies=no is
       set:</p>

<pre><code>   ·   Slice units will automatically have dependencies of type Conflicts=
       and Before= on shutdown.target. These ensure that slice units are
       removed prior to system shutdown. Only slice units involved with
       late system shutdown should disable DefaultDependencies= option.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="resouce-control">resouce-control</h3>
<p>For slice.slice, scope.scope, service.service, socket.socket, mount.mount, swap.swap
IMPLICIT DEPENDENCIES
       The following dependencies are implicitly added:
       ·   Units with the Slice= setting set automatically acquire Requires=
           and After= dependencies on the specified slice unit.</p>

<pre><code>   Slice=
       The name of the slice unit to place the unit in. Defaults to
       system.slice for all non-instantiated units of all unit types
       (except for slice units themselves see below). Instance units are
       by default placed in a subslice of system.slice that is named after
       the template name.
</code></pre>
