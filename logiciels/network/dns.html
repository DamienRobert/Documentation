<ul>
  <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types</li>
</ul>

<p>A = ipv4
AAAA = ipv6
NS = nameserver (design an authoritative dns)
MX = mail exchange record
TXT = arbitrary text
URL = Can be used for publishing mappings from hostnames to URIs. 
PTR = Pointer to a canonical name. Unlike a CNAME, DNS processing stops and just the name is returned. The most common use is for implementing reverse DNS lookups, but other uses include such things as DNS-SD.</p>

<p>Reverse dns:
dig 4.4.8.8.in-addr.arpa #reverse dns for 8.8.4.4
Ipv6: IPv6 address 2001:db8::567:89ab is b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa

<p>foo.example.com.        DNAME  bar.example.com.
bar.example.com.        A      192.0.2.23
xyzzy.bar.example.com.  A      192.0.2.24
*.bar.example.com.      A      192.0.2.25</p>

<p>An A record lookup for foo.example.com will return no data because a DNAME is not a CNAME and there is no A record directly at foo.
However, a lookup for xyzzy.foo.example.com will be DNAME mapped and return the A record for xyzzy.bar.example.com, which is 192.0.2.24. Lastly, a request for foobar.foo.example.com would be DNAME mapped and return 192.0.2.25.</p>

    <p>Note: this also allow to have a fqdn for the local host
eg if /etc/hostname is feanor, then hostname -f is feanor.home.lan
(unfortunately for this we need to put an explicit ip address)
[Note: another way to have a fqdn is to put “feanor.ploum” in
/etc/hostname. But in this case <code>hostname</code> is feanor.ploum, we would need
to use <code>hostname -s</code> to get feanor]</p>

Note: http://blog.tremily.us/posts/HOSTALIASES/ 
The HOSTALIASES file maps alias names to canonical host names, but the canonical name must be resolvable. You can’t specify an IP address as the target.
=&gt; so be wary of an ip alias, it get passed to the dns server and may fail
(but dnsmasq does support direct ipv4 queries) 
Cf https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/226260/hostaliases-file-with-an-ip-address

  address 127.0.0.2 (which is on the local loopback) and the IPv6 address
  ::1 (which is the local host).
- The hostnames “localhost” and “localhost.localdomain” (as well as any

  to the IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.
- The hostname “_gateway” is resolved to all current default routing gateway

<ul>
  <li>resolv.conf
nameserver ip_address
domain local_domain
search search_list
sortlist
options</li>
</ul>

<p>The domain and search keywords are mutually exclusive.   If  more  than
 one instance of these keywords is present, the last instance wins.</p>

<p>The  search keyword of a system’s resolv.conf file can be overridden on
 a per-process basis by setting the environment variable LOCALDOMAIN  to
 a space-separated list of search domains.</p>

<p>The  options keyword of a system’s resolv.conf file can be amended on a
 per-process basis by setting the environment variable RES_OPTIONS to  a
 space-separated  list  of resolver options.</p>

<ul>
  <li>resolvconf (man 8 resolvconf pour avoir le man de openresolv plutôt que celui de resolvectl), man resolvconf.conf
   resolvconf solves this by letting the daemon send their resolv.conf(5)
   file to resolvconf via stdin(4) with the argument -a interface[.protocol]</li>
</ul>

<p>resolvconf -v =&gt; the curernt configuration
resolvconf -p =&gt; the interface is marked as private, so the corresponding
nameserver is not added to NAMESERVERS</p>

<p>Usage:
  # resolv.conf from bge0
  search foo.com
  nameserver 1.2.3.4</p>

<p># resolv.conf from tap0
  domain bar.org
  nameserver 5.6.7.8</p>

<p>We will have
DOMAIN=bar.org
DOMAINS=”foo.com:1.2.3.4 bar.org:5.6.7.8”
SEARCH=”foo.com bar.org”
NAMESERVERS=”1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8”
If bge0 was marked private it would still be in DOMAINS but not in NAMESERVERS</p>

<p>Then this output is consumated by scripts like
/usr/lib/resolvconf/unbound
/usr/lib/resolvconf/libc is in charge of updating /etc/resolv.conf
and it calls /usr/lib/resolvconf/libc.d/* scripts</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Testing:
Unbound-host uses the unbound validating  resolver  to  query  for  the
     hostname and display results (so like dig, but queries the root dns
     directly)
     By default it reads no configuration file whatsoever.  It  attempts  to reach  the  internet  root servers.  With -C an unbound config file and with -r resolv.conf can be read
-v  Enable  verbose output and it shows validation results, on every line.
-C configfile

  </li>
  <li>Type of zones:</li>
  <li>stub: send query to other nameserver. The other nameserver is
authoritative, so you have to perform recursive processing yourself.</li>
  <li>forward: send query to other nameserver.  The other nameserver is a
recursive (caching) server.  So it performs recursion for you.</li>
  <li>local-zone: local data.
Eg local-zone example.com redirect =&gt; answer all queries for this domain with a specific ip address, useful for (government enforced) blocking of sites, or making facebook.com go to 127.0.0.1 to keep the kids away from it, since it also blocks blabla.facebook.com and so on.</li>
  <li>
    <p>auth-zone: authority zone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private address:
private-address: 10.0.0.0/8 =&gt; can never return this range
private-domain: “example.com” =&gt; this domain can return private address. Note that local-zone can have private addresses too
domain-insecure: do not use dnssec for these domains (typically used with private-domain)</p>
  </li>
  <li>local-zone: set up a zone served by unbound
local-data: the data corresponding to the zone</li>
</ul>

<p>local-zone: <zone> <type>
              Configure  a  local zone. The type determines the answer to give
              if there is no  match  from  local-data.
local-data: "<resource record="" string="">"
local-data-ptr: "IPaddr name"
            Configure  local data shorthand for a PTR record with the reversed
            IPv4 or IPv6 address and the host name.</resource></type></zone></p>

inform/inform_deny,inform_redirect,

local-zone: “<domain>" redirect
local-data: "<domain> A 0.0.0.0"</domain></domain></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Options:
The default zones are localhost, reverse 127.0.0.1 and ::1, the  onion,
test,  invalid  and  the  AS112  zones. The AS112 zones are reverse DNS
zones for private use and reserved IP addresses for which the servers on
the internet cannot provide correct answers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Exemple: the default for localhost is
                 local-zone: “localhost.” redirect
                 local-data: “localhost. 10800 IN NS localhost.”
                 local-data: “localhost. 10800 IN

                 local-data: “localhost. 10800 IN AAAA ::1”</p>

<p>unblock-lan-zones: <yes or="" no="">
  If  enabled,  then  for private address space, the reverse lookups are no
  longer filtered. When enabled, only localhost, 127.0.0.1 reverse and ::1
  reverse zones are configured with default  local  zones.
  [so this is like doing `local-zone: "10.in-addr.arpa." nodefault ...`
  for all the private ip ranges]
insecure-lan-zones: <yes or="" no="">

  # Make sure to set do-not-query-localhost: yes . If yes, the above default
  # do-not-query-address entries are present.  if no, localhost can be queried
  # (for testing and debugging). 
    do-not-query-localhost: no #default yes</p>

<p># File with trusted keys, kept up to date using RFC5011 probes, initial file
  # like trust-anchor-file, then it stores metadata.  Use several entries, one
  # per domain name, to track multiple zones. If you use forward-zone below to
  # query the Google DNS servers you MUST comment out this option or all DNS
  # queries will fail.

<p># Should additional section of secure message also be kept clean of unsecure

<p># Unbound can query your NSD or BIND server for private domain queries too.
  # On our NSD page we have NSD configured to serve the private domain,
  # “home.lan”. Here we can tell Unbound to connect to the NSD server when it
  # needs to resolve a *.home.lan hostname or IP.
  #
  # private-domain: “home.lan”
  # local-zone: “0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.” nodefault
  # stub-zone:
  #      name: “home.lan”
  #      stub-addr: 10.0.0.111@53</p>

<p># If you have an internal or private DNS names the external DNS servers can
  # not resolve, then you can assign domain name strings to be redirected to a
  # seperate dns server. For example, our comapny has the domain
  # organization.com and the domain name internal.organization.com can not be
  # resolved by Google’s public DNS, but can be resolved by our private DNS
  # server located at 1.1.1.1. The following tells Unbound that any
  # organization.com domain, i.e. *.organization.com be dns resolved by 1.1.1.1
  # instead of the public dns servers.
  #
  # forward-zone:
  #    name: “organization.com”
  #    forward-addr: 1.1.1.1        # Internal or private DNS</p>

<p># Use the following forward-zone to forward all queries to Google DNS,
  # OpenDNS.com or your local ISP’s dns servers for example. To test resolution
  # speeds use “drill calomel.org @8.8.8.8” and look for the “Query time:” in
  # milliseconds.
  forward-zone:
   name: “.”
