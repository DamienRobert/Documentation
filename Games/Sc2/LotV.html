Macro:
2 bases 3-1-1 from 1-1-1 or 2-1-1 or 3-0-0
3 bases: 5-1-1, 2 ebays
  follow up: TvT: 5-2-1 into 4th cc + 8-2-1 or 7-3-1

<p>1 base all in: proxy four rax; 3 rax reapers
2 bases all in: 5-1-1, 1 ebay</p>

<p>Build notes:
- for 1 rax reaper, add a gas when adding the fact (except for hellions)
  add a gas after ebay
- supply depot: 21s, marine 18s, scv 12s
  =&gt; when building only scv, supply at 22/23 is ok
     scv + 1 rine =&gt; supply at 21/23
     scv + reactor rines =&gt; supply at 20/23
- refinery 21s, reaper 32s

<p>Variations:
- 2-1-1 =&gt; 2nd rax @ 21, supply + gaz @22, fact @23
- 1-1-1 =&gt; 20 supply, 21 factory, reactor on rax, 2nd gas
           21 supply if marine built before reactor
  Delayed 2-1-1: add barracks after factory+2nd depot+2nd gas
- 3-1-1 =&gt; third rax @23 rather than fact
- gaz first =&gt; factory@20 before depot@21/22</p>

Converge to a 5-1-1 with the standard three Tech Lab Barracks (research Combat Shield and Concussive Shell), two Reactor Barracks, Reactor Factory, and Reactor Starport. Produce the usual bio, Widow Mine, and Medivac.
Attack with everything you have when +1 Infantry attack is about to complete, which should be around 7:30. Again, some adjustments have to be made early on depending on Protoss’ build and decisions. For example, you can change Cyclone for Widow Mine.</li>
